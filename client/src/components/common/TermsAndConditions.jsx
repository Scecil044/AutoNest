        We are a credit broker, not a lender or an independent financial
        advisor. We can introduce you to a limited number of lenders & their
        finance products which may have different interest rates & charges. We
        may advise you on the products, subject to your personal circumstances,
        though you are not obliged to take our advice or recommendation. We do
        not charge you a fee. Whichever lender we introduce you to, we will
        receive commission from them (either a fixed fee or a fixed percentage
        of the amount you borrow). The lenders we work with could pay us
        commission at different rates. The amount of commission we receive does
        not affect the amount that you pay under your credit agreement. Finance
        subject to status. Guarantees may be required.
