  "Concept Finance t/a Essex Car Company is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, FRN: 678769 . All finance is subject to status and income. Written Quotation on request. We act as a credit broker not a lender. We work with a number of carefully selected credit providers who may be able to offer you finance for your purchase. We are only able to offer finance products from these providers. Concept Finance t/a Essex Car Company are a credit broker and not a lender. We can introduce you to a limited number of lenders and their finance products. We are not an independent financial advisor and we act as their agent for this introduction. We may advise you on the products, subject to your personal circumstances, though you are not obliged to take our advice or recommendation. We do not charge you a fee for our services. Whichever lender we introduce you to, we will typically receive commission from them (either a fixed fee or a fixed percentage of the amount you borrow). For your reassurance, all of the lenders we work with could pay commission at different rates, but the commission we receive does not influence the interest rate you will pay. Our aim is to secure finance for you at the lowest interest rate you are eligible for from our panel of lenders. If you ask us what the amount of commission is, we will tell you in good time before the Finance agreement";
